once upon a time, there lived a king. he had a very lavish lifestyle. but one day he lost his appetite, so he went and consulted a hermit. the hermit said him to excersice everyday and it will help him lead a good and healthy life. slowly the king was getting healthier and healthier. so there fore he lead a very happy life.
